<!-- Product Information -->
 <br><br>
<section class="product-info">
    <h2>Why does it works?</h2>
    <p style=" width: 50%; text-align: left;">
        Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not
simply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex
network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human
host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained
from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.


CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and
enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to
synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract.
<br>
It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De Simone falls
within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product s
base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific
knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy.

<br>
The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone,
which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and
efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate or
produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.
<br>
Supported by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the
dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering
proven and replicable clinical results.

        Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal health and adapt to individual dietary needs, offering flexibility to healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation.
        <h3>Original Formulation</h3>
        CDS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique combination of proprietary bacterial strains designed to maximize intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in proprietary Master Cell Banks, ensuring purity, quality, and consistency in every production
        <h3>Guaranteed Safety</h3>
        Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Thanks to a short supply chain approved by the inventor, the product maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to packaging
        <h3>Affordability</h3>
        CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing equivalent quantities of bacteria. Efficient production and direct cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the market.

<h1>De <i style="color: rgb(18, 167, 159);">Simone</i> <i style="color: palevioletred;">Formulation</i></h1>
<p style="width: 60%;"> The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora s role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L’Aquila (Italy).<br>  
 He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book .Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and qualitycontrol of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks</p>
